    <p>My name is Evans Kanyi, I am a programmer mainly on HTML5 and CSS. I live in Ngong, Nairobi, just after<a href= https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nakumatt+Junction/@-1.2981156,36.7630702,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x53a90b01477e7c73!8m2!3d-1.2981156!4d36.7630702"> Nakumatt Junction</a>.

            <p1>And here is a version of my biography that will never be printed in corporate funding documents:</p1>
            <p>Having been born in Meru, in an Irrigation scheme I grew up with a dream of becoming a pilot. My dream was as a result of the small planes that usually flew the Horticulture from Meru to Nairobi. Both I and you know that very few archive
                their dreams. Lack of funds and lack of such course in public universities was one of the biggest contributors to the fall of my dream. In 2012 I was admitted in Multimedia University where I pursued a Degree in Mathematics and
                Computer Science. </p>
            <p>I started showing interest in Programing and after my Degree I joined Moringa School. This was after I realized that was offered in Public University was not enough for me to be a Programmer. I have participated in various group projects
                since then. As a person with a life-long love of technology, I continue to program both professionally and for fun.</p>
